Since is an equivalence relation, the relation is reflexive, so every element is related to itself. Since we are told , this means by symmetry that . Similarly, because and because . By transitivity, we have that and . To make writing the elements of easier to see, here is the equivalence relation as a diagram:   An equivalence relation as a digraph    N=5  f(t)=(cos(2*pi*t\/N), sin(2*pi*t\/N))    a  b  c  d  e       From this, we can more readily see that the relation will be .      Prove the relations below are equivalence relations, and describe the relation's equivalence classes.     The relation on , where if and only if is even.    We need to show that this relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  For any , so this is clearly even. Hence, , so is reflexive.  Suppose that with , so is even. This means that for some integer . Then, , which is even because . Therefore, as well. Thus, is symmetric.  Now, assume that with and . Therefore, and are both even, meaning that there exist integers and so that and . We thus have , which is even because . Therefore, , so is transitive. We conclude that is an equivalence relation.  To determine the equivalence classes, note that where the last equality follows because is even if and only if is even. (Further justification is left as an exercise for the reader :).) Similarly, note that where we used the fact that is even if and only if is odd (Also left as an exercise for the reader :).) Since the sets of even and odd integers partition the set of all integers, these are the equivalence classes.      The relation on as if and only if is even.    We will show that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Note that if , then which is clearly even, so . Thus, is reflexive. Clearly is symmetric: if with , then is even. Addition is commutative so is also even, meaning that Finally, let with and . Thus, and are both even, so there exist integers and where and . Solving for and , we get that and . Hence, which implies that is even because . Thus, , so the relation is transitive.  The equivalence classes are where we use the fact that is even if and only if is even (left as an exercise:) ), and where we use the fact that is even if and only if is odd (left as an exercise:) ). The sets of even and odd integers partition , so these are the equivalence classes.       Describe the partition of resulting from the equivalence relation .    The way congruence modulo partitions is based on the remainder after division. So, there are four equivalence classes:       Consider the following definitions for characters: the digits are the integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), the letters are the lowercase letters ( through ), and the special characters are . Compute the number of passwords that satisfy the given constraints.     Strings of length , where characters can be special characters, digits, or letters.    The sets of special characters, digits, and letters are all mutually disjoint, which means that by the sum rule the total number of characters will be . Then, each of the six characters in the string can be any of the characters, so there are a total of possible passwords.      Strings of length or . Characters can be special characters, digits, or letters.    The strings of length , , and are mutually disjoint, so by the sum rule we have that there are possible passwords.      Strings of length , or . Characters can be special characters, digits, or letters. The first character cannot be a letter.    When choosing a string of length where the first character is not a letter, there are available choices for the first character between digits and special characters, and choices remaining for the remaining elements of the string. Hence, for a string of length subject to these constraints, there are choices. The sets of strings of lengths , , and are mutually disjoint, so by the sum rule, the total number of strings subject to the given constraints will be       The password must be a string of length . Characters can be special characters, digits, or letters, with no repeated characters.    Since there are a total of characters, and characters are not repeated, there is choices for the first character, choices for the second character, choices for the third, etc. Hence, the total number of strings of length without character repetitions is .      The password must be a string of length . Characters can be special characters, digits, or letters, with no repeated characters. The first character cannot be a special character.    Since the first character cannot be a special character, there are choices for the first character. Once the first character has been chosen, then there are choices for the second character because we do not allow for repeated characters. For the third character, there will be choices, etc. Hence, the total number of strings of length with no repetitions in which the first character is not a special character will be .         Find a function from the set to that is a -to- correspondence. (The division, ceiling, or floor operations may be useful here.)    One possibility is . This is a -to- correspondence because for , the numbers that will get mapped to under will be , , and (which are all elements of ).      How many strings are there over the set that have length in which no two consecutive characters are the same? For example, the string abcbcbabcb counts, and the strings abbbcbabcb and aacbcbabcb do not count.    There are choices for the first character in the string, and choices for the second character. For the third, since we cannot have two consecutive characters be the same, we therefore have choices. Similarly, there are choices for the fourth, etc. Hence, there are strings of length in which no two consecutive characters are the same.      A girl scout troop with ten girl scouts and two leaders goes on a hike. When the path narrows, the troop must walk in single file with a leader at the front and a leader at the back. How many ways are there for the entire troop (including the girl scouts and the leaders) to line up?    There are choices for the leader at the front. Then, there are choices made for the ten girl scouts in the middle. Finally, there is one choice for the leader at the back of the line. Hence there are ways to line up the entire troop.      Suppose a network has 40 computers of which five fail.     How many possibilities are there for the five that fail?    Note that this is the same as selecting a subset of five computers from a set of computers. There are ways to do this.      Suppose that three of the computers in the network have a copy of a particular file. How many sets of failures wipe out all the copies of the file? That is, how many -subsets contain the three computers that have the file?    In this context, any such -subset of computers that fail must contain the three computers that have the file. The two remaining computers in the subset must then be selected from the computers that did not contain the file. Thus, the number of such -subsets in which the three computers with the file fail is the number of ways to select two computers from the computers without the file, which is .       A search committee is formed to find a new software engineer to hire.     If applicants apply for the job, how many hays are there to select a subset of applicants for a short list?    There are ways to select applicants out of .      If of the are selected for an interview, how many ways are there to pick the set of applicants who are interviewed? (Assume that the short list is already decided.)    There are ways to pick the set of applicants who are interviewed.      Based on the interview, the committee will rank the top applicants and submit the list to the boss who will make the final decision. (Assume that the interviewees are already decided.) How many ways are there to select the list from the applicants?    Since the applicants will be ranked, they are ordered. Therefore, there are ways to select an ordered list of people without repetitions from a set of applicants.      "

Similarly, note that where we used the fact that is even if and only if is odd (Also left as an exercise for the reader :).) Since the sets of even and odd integers partition the set of all integers, these are the equivalence classes.      The relation on as if and only if is even.    We will show that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Note that if , then which is clearly even, so . Thus, is reflexive. Clearly is symmetric: if with , then is even. Addition is commutative so is also even, meaning that Finally, let with and . Thus, and are both even, so there exist integers and where and . Solving for and , we get that and .

The equivalence classes are where we use the fact that is even if and only if is even (left as an exercise:) ), and where we use the fact that is even if and only if is odd (left as an exercise:) ).
