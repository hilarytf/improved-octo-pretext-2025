  <title>Tolerance</title>

  <p> Investigate limits through tolerance problems. </p>

  <outcomes>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph piecewise-defined functions and parabolas by hand.</li>
      <li>Graphically add output tolerance (epsilon) information to the graph of the function (i.e. sketch horizontal lines).</li>
      <li>Use the graph and output tolerance lines to sketch vertical lines to show the input tolerance.</li>
      <li>Algebraically determine the input tolerance (delta) that guarantees f(x) is within a given output tolerance (epsilon) given a function.</li>
      <li>Use the graph and output/input tolerance (epsilon/delta) windows to confirm results found algebraically. </li>
      <li>Algebraically determine the input tolerance (delta) that guarantees f(x) is within a given output tolerance (epsilon) from a word problem.</li>
