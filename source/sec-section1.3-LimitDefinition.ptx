  <title>Limit Definition</title>

  <p> Build a definition of limit. </p>

  <outcomes>
    <ul>
      <li>State the definition of limit: The limit of a function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> is a number <m>L</m> (if it exists) such that <m>f(x)</m> is as close to <m>L</m> as we want whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m> (but <m>x</m> does not equal <m>c</m>).</li>
      <li>Express the limit <m>(L)</m> of a function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> using mathematical notation. </li>
      <li>Explain why a table showing (exact) values of a function <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> values close to <m>c</m> cannot conclusively establish the value of the limit of the function as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>. </li>
      <li>Use the definition of limit and the graph of a function to explain why a limit does not exist.</li>
      <li>Use the Limit Properties to find the limits of combinations functions as <m>x</m> approaches some number <m>c</m>, given the limits of these functions as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>.</li>
    </ul>
